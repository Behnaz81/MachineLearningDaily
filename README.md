# Machine Learning Daily Practice

This repository contains my daily machine learning notebooks. I'm an undergraduate computer engineering student. To gain a deeper understanding I'm practicing every day — reviewing concepts, building small projects, and documenting my learning journey here.

## 🗓️ Goal

Build a strong foundation in machine learning through daily practice — one notebook, one concept, or one mini-project each day.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Classification with Scikit-learn
- Regression models
- Clustering
- Feature engineering
- Model evaluation
- Basics of Neural Networks (coming soon)
- Deep Learning (coming soon)

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter / Google Colab
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
