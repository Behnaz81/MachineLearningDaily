# Day 09 â€“ Intro to `NLP`

## What We Did

- Searched for words within texts
- Found semantically similar words
- Compared shared contexts between words
- Loaded and explored the built-in corpora from `nltk.book`

## Next Step

For the next step we'll focus on:

- Tokenization  
- Stop word removal  
- Lemmatization  

using both NLTK and spaCy.
