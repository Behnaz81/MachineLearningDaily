# Day 2: Iris Dataset Classification

Today I worked on building simple classification models using the famous Iris dataset.

## Goals:
- Load and explore the Iris dataset
- Visualize feature distributions and class separations
- Train and evaluate K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Logistic Regression models

## What I did:
- Used pandas and seaborn to analyze the dataset
- Visualized pairwise relationships with seaborn's `pairplot`
- Built a KNN classifier (k=3) and evaluated its accuracy
- Built a Logistic Regression model and compared it to KNN
- Explored how the accuracy of KNN changes with different k values
- Printed classification reports for deeper insight

## Tools:
- Python, Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)
- scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn

## Next Step:
I will continue learning and practicing classification, and gradually move to more complex datasets and models.
